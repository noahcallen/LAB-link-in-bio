## 🪵 Background & Story

Sapling.io is one of the very first projects I built as a developer. It started as a simple way to learn the fundamentals of web development — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — but it quickly became something more meaningful.

I'm passionate about giving back to the tech community and believe in building tools that empower others. Sapling.io is open source because I want small creators, artists, freelancers, and dreamers to have access to beautiful, functional tools without a paywall.

This project is a small contribution to a much bigger ecosystem of collaboration, creativity, and growth. My hope is that Sapling.io helps you share your voice, build your brand, and grow your presence — no matter where you’re starting from.
